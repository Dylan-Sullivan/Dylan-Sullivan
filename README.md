- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dylan-Sullivan
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics engineering from all aspects: mechanical, electrical, and software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the engineering process for building a robotic/mechatronic system, aside from my academic work in mechanical and mechatronics engineering. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything pertaining to robotics. I have experience modeling physical parts in SOLIDWORKS and using the Arduino as an embedded system
      for robotics applications. I would like to learn more about the electronics behind robotics.
