- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dylan-Sullivan
- I am currently studying mechanical engineering at Montana State University with an emphasis/minor in mechatronics
- I am working part time as a Service Engineer at a drone manufacturing company called Vision Aerial
- 👀 I’m working towards becoming a Robotics Engineer and I am interested in aquiring skillsets within all aspects of robotic systems, i.e., mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems.
- 💞️ I am using my github account primarily to showcase the work I have been doing in Udacity's Robotics Software Engineering Course, and to come, I will also upload the Assembly and C code that I have been developing in my introduction to embedded systems design course at MSU.
